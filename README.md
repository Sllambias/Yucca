# Yucca
End-to-end modular machine learning framework for classification, segmentation and unsupervised learning. Yucca is designed to be plug-and-play while still allowing for effortless customization. This allows users to employ the basic Yucca models as solid baselines, but it also allows users to change and experiment with exact features in a robust and thoroughly tested research environment. The Yucca project is inspired by Fabien Isensee's [nnUNet](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet).

# Installation

## Install an editable version of the project with Cuda support using Conda

Create a python=3.10 environment exclusively for Yucca to avoid conflicts with other projects. 

IMPORTANT: First install Pytorch for GPU following appropriate instructions from e.g. https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/.
Then navigate to Yucca and install the package from there.

For an Ubuntu system with Cuda 11.7:
```
> conda create -n yuccaenv python=3.10
> conda activate yuccaenv
> conda install -c anaconda setuptools
> conda install -c "nvidia/label/cuda-11.7.1" cuda-toolkit
> conda install pytorch==1.13.1 torchvision==0.14.1 torchaudio==0.13.1 pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia
> git clone https://github.com/Sllambias/yucca.git
> cd yucca
> pip install -e .
```
To use other CUDA or PyTorch versions refer to 1. for the current PyTorch installation, 2. for previous versions and 3. for the appropriate CUDA toolkit. Note that the CUDA versions used in the PyTorch and CUDA-toolkit installations should match (in the example above both use 11.7) 

1. https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
2. https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/
3. https://anaconda.org/nvidia/cuda-toolkit

## Install the package as a dependency in another project
If you just want to install Yucca locally on your computer, use
```
pip install git+https://github.com/Sllambias/yucca.git
```
this will install the code from github, not an eventual local clone.

# Task Conversion

Prior to preprocessing and training all datasets must be converted to a Yucca-compliant task. This is done to ensure reproducibility and eliminate data leakage. For a tutorial see the [Task Conversion Guide](yucca/documentation/tutorials/task_conversion.md).

# Preprocessing

Preprocessing is carried out using the `yucca_preprocess` command. For advanced use see: [`run_scripts_advanced.py`](yucca/documentation/tutorials/run_scripts_advanced.md#preprocessing)

Basic usage of the preprocessing command relies on three components. 
  1. The target data to be preprocessed specified with the required **-t** flag. This data must be converted into a Yucca-compliant task beforehand.
  2. The Planner class. The Planner is responsible for determining *what* we do in preprocessing and *how* it is done. This includes setting the normalization, resizing, resampling and transposition operations and any values associated with them. The planner class defaults to the YuccaPlanner but it can also be any custom planner found or created in the [Planner directory](yucca/planning) and its subdirectories.  The planner can be changed using the **-pl** flag.  
  3. The Preprocessor class. The Preprocessor is a work horse, that receives an instruction manual from the Planner which it carries out. The Preprocessor can be one YuccaPreprocessor, ClassificationPreprocessor and UnsupervisedPreprocessor. The only aspect in which they differ is how they expect the ground truth to look. The YuccaPreprocessor expects to find images, the ClassificationPreprocessor expects to find .txt files with image-level classes and the UnsupervisedPreprocessor expects to not find any ground truth. The default is the YuccaPreprocessor, but this can be changed using the **-pr** flag. 

An example of preprocessing a task called `Task001_Brains` with the default planner and the ClassificationPreprocessor:
```
> yucca_preprocess -t Task001_Brains -pr ClassificationPreprocessor
```

# Training

Training is carried out using the `yucca_train` command, which calls the [`run_training.py`](yucca/run/run_training.py) script. Prior to training the `yucca_preprocessing` command must be used to preprocess data and create the appropriate plan folder and `_plans.json` file. For help and all the available arguments see the output of the `-h` flag below.

```console
> yucca_train -h
usage: yucca_train [-h] [-t TASK] [-m M] [-d D] [-tr TR] [-pl PL] [-f F] [--lr LR] [--loss LOSS] [--mom MOM] [--continue_train]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t TASK, --task TASK  Name of the task used for training. The data should already be preprocessed using yucca_preprocessArgument should be of format: TaskXXX_MYTASK
  -m M                  Model Architecture. Should be one of MultiResUNet or UNet Note that this is case sensitive. Defaults to the standard UNet.
  -d D                  Dimensionality of the Model. Can be 3D, 25D or 2D. Defaults to 3D.
  -tr TR                Trainer Class to be used. Defaults to the basic YuccaTrainer
  -pl PL                Plan ID to be used. This specifies which plan and preprocessed data to use for training on the given task. Defaults to the YuccaPlans folder
  -f F                  Fold to use for training. Unless manually assigned, folds [0,1,2,3,4] will be created automatically. Defaults to training on fold 0
  --lr LR               Should only be used to employ alternative Learning Rate. Format should be scientific notation e.g. 1e-4.
  --loss LOSS           Should only be used to employ alternative Loss Function
  --mom MOM             Should only be used to employ alternative Momentum.
  --continue_train      continue training a previously saved checkpoint.
```
To start training using the default Trainer Class and plans file simply supply (1) the task with `-t` (2) the model architecture with `-m` and (3) the dimensions with `-d`. An example of training on a task called `Task001_Brains`, using a 3D `MultiResUnet`:
```
> yucca_train -t Task001_Brains -m MultiResUNet
```

By default this will use the [YuccaTrainerV2](yucca/training/trainers/YuccaTrainerV2.py). To change Trainer use the `-tr` flag. The Trainer Class defines the model training parameters. This includes: learning rate, learning rate scheduler, momentum, loss function, optimizer, batch size, epochs, foreground oversampling, patch size and data augmentation scheme. To change the values of these parameters see [Changing Parameters](yucca/documentation/tutorials/changing_parameters.md#model--training). To use plan files created by non-default Planners use `-pl` and specify the name of the alternative plan file. To specify which fold to train on use `-f`. By default training is done on fold 0 (unless manually specified we create 5 random splits).

An example of training on a task called `Task002_NotBrains`, using a 2D `MultiResUnet` with the `CustomTrainer` and `CustomPlans` on fold 3:
```
> yucca_train -t Task002_NotBrains -m MultiResUNet -d 2D -tr CustomTrainer -pl CustomPlans -f 3
```

# Inference

Inference is carried out using the `yucca_inference` command, which calls the [`run_inference.py`](yucca/run/run_inference.py) script. This relies on models previously trained using the `yucca_train` command. For help and all the available arguments see the output of the `-h` flag below. 

```console
> yucca_inference -h
usage: yucca_inference [-h] -s S -t T [-f F] [-m M] [-d D] [-tr TR] [-pl PL] [-chk CHK] [--ensemble] [--not_strict] [--save_softmax] [--overwrite] [--no_eval] [--predict_train]

options:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  -s S             Name of the source task i.e. what the model is trained on. Should be of format: TaskXXX_MYTASK
  -t T             Name of the target task i.e. the data to be predicted. Should be of format: TaskXXX_MYTASK
  -f F             Select the fold that was used to train the model desired for inference. Defaults to looking for a model trained on fold 0.
  -m M             Model Architecture. Defaults to UNet.
  -d D             2D, 25D or 3D model. Defaults to 3D.
  -tr TR           Full name of Trainer Class. e.g. 'YuccaTrainer_DCE' or 'YuccaTrainerV2'. Defaults to YuccaTrainerV2.
  -pl PL           Plan ID. Defaults to YuccaPlannerV2
  -chk CHK         Checkpoint to use for inference. Defaults to checkpoint_best.
  --ensemble       Used to initialize data preprocessing for ensemble/2.5D training
  --not_strict     Strict determines if all expected modalities must be present, with the appropriate suffixes (e.g. '_000.nii.gz'). Only touch if you know what you're doing.
  --save_softmax   Save softmax outputs. Required for softmax fusion.
  --overwrite      Overwrite existing predictions
  --no_eval        Disable evaluation and creation of metrics file (result.json)
  --predict_train  Predict on the training set. Useful for debugging.
```

To run inference using the default Trainer Class, plan file and folds supply (1) the source task (what the model is trained on) with `-s` (2) the target task (what we want to predict) with `-t` (3) the model architecture with `-m` and (4) the dimensions with `-d`.

An example of running inference on the test set of a task called `Task001_Brains`, using a 3D `MultiResUnet` trained on the same task:
```
> yucca_inference -s Task001_Brains -t Task001_Brains -m MultiResUNet
```
If, on the other hand, we were to run inference on a new task called Task002_NotBrains, using a 2D UNet trained on Task001_Brains with a custom Trainer Class:
```
> yucca_inference -s Task001_Brains -t Task002_NotBrains -d 2D -tr CustomTrainer
```

# Ensembles

Using an ensemble of models can be achieved manually and automatically. 
The automatic method trains 3 models on the axial, sagittal and coronal views and combine these in inference. It is called using the `--ensemble` flag available for [`yucca_preprocess`](#preprocessing), [yucca_train](#training) and [yucca_inference](#inference). The preprocessor will preprocess the selected Task 3 times, one for each of the views, and save the preprocessed datasets in separate folders with the suffixes `X`, `Y` and `Z`, e.g. `yucca_preprocessed/TaskXXX_MYTASK/YuccaPlannerV2X`. The trainer will train a model on each of the three views and save the trained models using the same suffixes, e.g. `yucca_models/TaskXXX_MYTASK/YuccaTrainerV2_YuccaPlannerV2X`. Then, the softmax outputs from the three models are fused to create the final prediction and saved in a folder suffixed by `_Ensemble`, e.g. `yucca_results/TaskXXX_MYTASK/UNet2D/YuccaTrainerV2_YuccaPlannerV2_Ensemble`.

The manual method can be used to speed up the process or use different ensembles og e.g. different folds rather than views. The speedup comes from the fact that the `--ensemble` flag isn't capable of handling parallel model training, it is therefore quite slow as models will only be trained sequentially. To "parallelize" this, you can train models on each of the three preprocessed datasets:
```console
> yucca_train -t Task002_NotBrains -d 2D -pl YuccaPlannerV2X
> yucca_train -t Task002_NotBrains -d 2D -pl YuccaPlannerV2Y
> yucca_train -t Task002_NotBrains -d 2D -pl YuccaPlannerV2Z
```
Preprocessing and inference can also be "parallelized" in the same way, but that will rarely be necessary for speed optimization as these are fairly fast operations.
